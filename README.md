This is a self-contained demo for a Nucleo-L432KC board using some peripherals:
- 8 LED
- 1 buzzer
- 2 push buttons
- 1 analog input
- serial comm with a terminal prog on the host

The pinout corresponds to the Computer Engineering base board, see Doc,
which is equipped with the corresponding peripheral components.

The project builds with Visual Studio Code and the STM32 extension.
All neccessary CMSIS core header files are included. No other libraries are used.
